Game for MSCH-C220 Game Technology at Indiana University 2020

In this game, you are an Android bot trying to escape the real world "bugs". You will have to reach the flag to move on to the next level. 

You start with 100 health and each time you are hit by the "bugs", your health goes down 10. Once you reach 0, the game is over.

Once you beat all the levels, you will see a congratulations message. 

Good luck!
